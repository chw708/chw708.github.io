```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              ‚úÖ (Root location - REQUIRED)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy.yml          ‚úÖ (Auto-deployment workflow)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 404.html            ‚úÖ (SPA routing support)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .nojekyll           ‚úÖ (Bypass Jekyll processing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                    ‚úÖ (Source code)

```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Repository Settings
- Go to your repository: `https://github.com/chw708/chw708.github.io`
- Navigate to **Settings > Pages**
- Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions"

### 2. Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment
- Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
- Watch the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- Deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes

### 4. Access Your Site
Once deployed, your app will be live at: **https://chw708.github.io/**

## üîß What Was Fixed

### ‚úÖ Path Configuration
- Changed CSS link from `./src/index.css` to `/src/index.css`

- Added proper SPA routing support

### ‚úÖ GitHub Actions Workflow
- Configured automatic deployment on push to main branch

### ‚úÖ SPA Support

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Always use absolute paths** starting with `/` for assets in production
2. **Don't move index.html** from the root directory
3. **Wait for deployment** to complete before testing (check Actions tab)
4. **Clear browser cache** if you don't see changes immediately

## üîç Troubleshooting

If the site doesn't load:
1. Check the Actions tab for deployment errors
2. Verify GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" in repository settings
3. Ensure the repository name is exactly `chw708.github.io`
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
