# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for Teresa Health

## Quick Setup

Your Teresa Health app is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment with the latest fixes for proper loading.

### Recent Fixes Applied:
- ✅ Updated Vite configuration for user GitHub Pages site (`chw708.github.io`)
- ✅ Fixed base path configuration to use `/` for user sites
- ✅ Updated deployment workflow to use modern GitHub Pages actions
- ✅ Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
- ✅ Updated Node.js version to 20 in deployment workflow

### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Make sure your repository is correctly set up:**
   - Repository name: `chw708.github.io` ✓
   - Repository should be public ✓
   
2. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment - app ready"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/chw708/chw708.github.io/settings/pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The deployment will start automatically

4. **Access your app:**
   - Your app will be available at: https://chw708.github.io
   - First deployment takes 5-10 minutes

## What happens automatically:

- When you push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Build your React app with production settings
  3. Deploy it to GitHub Pages
  4. Make it available at your GitHub Pages URL

## Repository Settings Check:

Make sure these settings are correct in your GitHub repository:

1. **Repository name:** `chw708.github.io` (exactly this)
2. **Visibility:** Public
3. **Pages source:** GitHub Actions (not "Deploy from a branch")

## Troubleshooting:

**App not loading?**
- Wait 10 minutes after first deployment
- Check repository is public
- Verify Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Clear browser cache and try again

**Build failing?**
- Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
- Look for error messages in the build logs
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

**404 on page refresh?**
- This is normal for single-page apps on GitHub Pages
- The app will work correctly when loaded from the home page

## Development:

- For local development: `npm run dev`
- Your production app will be automatically built and deployed when you push to GitHub
