# Teresa Health Deployment Guide

## Current Status

Your Teresa Health app is configured for GitHub Pages deployment. Here's what needs to be done to make it work at https://chw708.github.io:

## Step-by-Step Deployment:

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
- Your repository should be named `chw708.github.io`
- Push all these files to the main branch of that repository

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. Save the settings

### 3. Automatic Deployment
- The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will automatically:
  - Build your React app when you push to main branch
  - Deploy it to GitHub Pages
  - Make it accessible at https://chw708.github.io

### 4. Verification
After pushing, check:
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Watch the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run
3. Once complete (green checkmark), visit https://chw708.github.io

## Files Configured for Deployment:

✅ `index.html` - Main HTML file with proper React app setup
✅ `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration for GitHub Pages
✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Automated deployment workflow
✅ `public/404.html` - SPA routing support for GitHub Pages
✅ `public/.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing
✅ `package.json` - Build scripts configured

## Troubleshooting:

### If the site shows 404:
- Verify repository name is exactly `chw708.github.io`
- Check that GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Wait a few minutes after deployment completes

### If the site loads but appears broken:
- Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify all assets are loading properly
- Check the GitHub Actions logs for build warnings

### If deployment fails:
- Check the GitHub Actions tab for error details
- Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
- Verify the build script runs without errors

## Local Testing:

To test locally before deploying:

```bash
npm install
npm run build:gh-pages
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` folder, which is what gets deployed to GitHub Pages.
